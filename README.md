iOS to Rails Images
===================

A quick project I threw together to figure out how to POST images from iOS to a Rails object and upload them via the Paperclip gem.

This repository contains the iOS (Image Tester) and Ruby on Rails (project_gallery) apps that I used to test the code.  The important parts of each one are:

'''ruby
  require 'stuff'
'''
